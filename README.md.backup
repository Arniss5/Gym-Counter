## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Increment and decrement the number of repeats per session
- Save the repeats to the list
- See the current session after refreshing/restarting their browser
- Reset current session
- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

With this project I practised creating responsive applications. I also got more experience manipulating DOM and writing JS functions. I set onclick events on buttons. I learned how to save data in local storage.

```html
<button class="tracker-btn" id="increment" onclick="increment()">Increment</button>
```
```css
:root {
    --primary: rgb(133, 215, 0);
}
```
```js
prevRepeats.textContent = localStorage.getItem('gymSession')
}
```



### Continued development

I'm planning on exploring more DOM manipulation methods. I will practice writing more complex JS functions.
